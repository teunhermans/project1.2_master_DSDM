    <h1> Welcome to LuceVM</h1>

    <p> It's working! Congratulations on setting up LuceVM&trade; <br><br>
    LuceVM is a self-contained virtual machine to facilitate web3 development using the python stack. <br> Most importantly LuceVM allows to compile, deploy and interact with Ethereum Smart Contracts <br>from a Python environment in a seamless manner. It also provides additional functionality but let's <br>keep it simple for now.
    </p>

    <b>Next steps: </b><br>  
    Open up another browser window at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888">127.0.0.1:8888</a> to access the Jupyter environment. <br>
    There you will find sample notebooks on how to interact with 
    Ethereum and specifically <br>the LUCE Smart Contract from Python.
