His github link is: https://github.com/irfankaradeniz/LUCE_Model_Monitoring

In this repository, both of the previous are combined, a smart contract is developped and tested to upload machine learning models on LUCE, the smart contract can be found at luce_vm\jupyter\data\Model.sol.
This smart contract is tested on jupyter notebook, the notebook on which this is done can be found at luce_vm\jupyter\modelContractTest.ipynb.
